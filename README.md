# 🌿 Plant Identification and Medicinal Recommendations App  

This project is a **Streamlit-powered Plant Identification System** that leverages **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and the intelligence of **GeminiAI**. It allows users to upload an image of a leaf, identifies the plant species, and provides detailed insights, including **medicinal uses** and **recommendations** for health-related applications.

---

## 🌟 Features  

- **Accurate Plant Identification**: Detects plant species from leaf images using a trained machine learning model.  
- **Medicinal Insights**: Recommends potential medicinal uses and other plant-related information, powered by GeminiAI.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and seamless experience.  
- **Fast and Scalable**: Handles multiple queries with high performance.
